# SchedulingAnalysis
Efficient scheduling determines process execution order, affecting metrics like turnaround, waiting, and response time. This Python project compares five algorithms: FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, HRRN, and EDF. Through simulations, it evaluates their performance, offering insights into selecting suitable strategies for different applications.
